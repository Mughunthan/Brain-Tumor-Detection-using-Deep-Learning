# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
## This is based on classification of MRI image to know if the MRI image shows any signs of brain tumor or not and if yes, what type of tumor (3 types) .We use Data directory flow, Convolutional Neural Network from Keras and Sequential Model with OpenCV for creation of model.
